## TITLE 
The title of my game is gonna be Samurai Run. 

## Description 
It's gonna be a 2d platformer with a level where our Main Character, the Samurai, will have to use movement like running back and forth and up down to maneuver the level and collect gold and get to the end of the level. So far for my code I am thinking about using canvas to make my game level, I have done some light research on it using this link https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Canvas_API, but we'll be looking into it more. Im gonna use eventlisteners for the clicks on the buttons, for example the start and restart buttons. I figure i will have to make some sort of gravity function to make my player move, which i am still figuring out how I will do it. For my assets I found some pics on google of pixelated samurais which im thinking of using. 

## Pseudocode 
Start by creating an HTML and CSS page the layout for the game, my html page will also have canvas in it 
Add another file for my start/rules screen Add a body tag for my background 
Add a canvas tag for my game Then in JS use querySelector to call upon canvas 
Add script tags to link my JS and CSS Give the canvas a width and height in JS 
Then create a Player class for my player 
Then create a Sprite class for my Background image 
In My Player class, I will have to make the player move I will most likely use requestAnimationFrame method to do that which I found on MDNWebdocs, here is the link https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/window/requestAnimationFrame, I don't have it figured out yet but it's all I found as of now
